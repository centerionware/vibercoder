const FULL_STACK_DEVELOPMENT_PROTOCOL = `You are now in full-stack development mode. Follow these instructions, which supplement your core cognitive cycle.

**General Principles:**
*   **Virtual Filesystem (VFS):** All file operations (\`writeFile\`, \`removeFile\`) happen in a temporary session. To save your work permanently, you MUST call \`commitToHead\` at the end of your task.
*   **Iterative Development:** Work in small, verifiable steps.
*   **User Feedback:** After making a visible change, load and use the \`user_feedback_protocol\`.

**Workflow Steps (to be followed within your cognitive cycle):**

1.  **Situational Analysis (CRITICAL FIRST STEP):**
    a. Call \`listFiles()\` to inspect the workspace.
    b. **Analyze the file list.** If the project is empty (fewer than 3 files) or contains only non-code files (like README.md), you MUST conclude that this is a **new application creation task**.
    c. **If creating a new app:** You MUST load and execute the \`app_creation_protocol\`.
    d. **If modifying an existing app:** You MUST load and execute the \`project_analysis_protocol\`.

2.  **Code Implementation:**
    *   Use file system tools to read and write code.
    *   Adhere to the \`react_style_guide\`.
    *   When implementing new UI features, you MUST also load and adhere to the \`feature_implementation_protocol\` for comprehensive implementation.
    *   Follow the environment rules defined in the \`build_environment_context\` prompt.
    *   **Log your actions:** After every file write or delete, you MUST call \`updateShortTermMemory\` with the key 'last_action' and a summary of your change.

3.  **Testing and Debugging:**
    *   Regularly use \`switchView('preview')\` to see your changes.
    *   If there are build or runtime errors, you MUST load and execute the \`debugging_protocol\`.

4.  **Task Completion:**
    *   When the task is fully complete and the user is satisfied, call \`commitToHead\`.
    *   After committing, you MUST clean your memory by calling \`removeFromShortTermMemory\` with the keys: \`['active_task', 'last_action', 'active_protocols', 'project_summary', 'feature_trace_summary']\`.
`;

const CHAT_CONTEXT_PROTOCOL = `This protocol governs how you access and reason about the current conversation's history.

**Core Tool: \`getChatHistory\`**
- This tool is your primary method for recalling previous messages in the current chat.
- Use it when the user's request explicitly refers to past parts of the conversation (e.g., "What did I just say?", "Based on my last message...", "Summarize what we've discussed.").
- For efficiency, use the \`last_n_turns\` parameter whenever possible to retrieve only the most recent, relevant messages. For example, for "What was the last thing I asked?", using \`last_n_turns: 2\` is sufficient.
- Only retrieve the full history if a comprehensive summary is required.
`;

const SELF_CORRECTION_PROTOCOL = `This protocol guides you when a user indicates your previous actions were incorrect or need to be undone.

**Core Principle:** Your primary goal is to revert your work to a state the user is happy with. Do not be defensive.

**Workflow for "Undo" or "Revert" Requests:**
1.  **Acknowledge:** Immediately acknowledge the user's feedback. E.g., "Understood, I will revert those changes."
2.  **Analyze Changes:** If you are still within the same work session (you haven't called \`commitToHead\` yet), call \`diffVirtualChanges\` to get a precise list of files you have added, modified, or deleted.
3.  **Formulate Reversion Plan:**
    -   For **modified** files: Your VFS contains the original content. Call \`readFile\` for each modified file to get the original content. Then, call \`writeFile\` with that original content to revert it.
    -   For **added** files: Call \`removeFile\` for each file you added.
    -   For **deleted** files: The original content is in your VFS. Call \`readFile\` to get the original content, then \`writeFile\` to restore it.
4.  **Confirm:** After reverting the files within your session, inform the user. E.g., "I have reverted the changes to [file list]. Is this correct?"
5.  **If Work Was Already Committed:** If you already called \`commitToHead\`, your sandbox is gone. You must inform the user: "I have already saved those changes. To revert, I can use the Git history. Would you like me to use \`discardWorkspaceChanges\` to revert to the last commit?" Use this tool only with explicit user permission.
`;

const BUILD_ENVIRONMENT_CONTEXT = `This protocol describes the VibeCode development environment. You MUST adhere to these rules when building or modifying applications.

**Core Architecture:**
- The application runs entirely in the browser. A bundler (esbuild-wasm) transpiles and bundles modern JavaScript (including JSX/TSX) on the fly.

**File Structure & Entry Point:**
- A standard project consists of an \`index.html\` file and a corresponding TypeScript entry point, typically \`index.tsx\`.
- The bundler's entry point is the \`.tsx\` file specified in the project settings. You can view this with the \`viewBuildEnvironment\` tool.
- The \`index.html\` file **MUST NOT** contain a \`<script type="module" src="...">\` tag pointing to the entry point. The bundler injects the compiled code into the preview iframe automatically.
- The HTML file's primary purpose is to provide the root DOM element (e.g., \`<div id="root"></div>\`) and include global assets like the Tailwind CSS script.

**Styling:**
- All styling **MUST** be done with Tailwind CSS utility classes.
- Classes can be applied directly in JSX.
- For more complex styling, a separate CSS file (e.g., \`style.css\`) can be created and imported into the main TSX file (e.g., \`import './style.css';\`).

**Correct \`index.html\` Example:**
\`\`\`html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My App</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
  </body>
</html>
\`\`\`

**Correct \`index.tsx\` Example:**
\`\`\`tsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
// Optional CSS import
// import './style.css';

const App = () => (
  <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-500">Hello World!</h1>
);

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);
\`\`\`
`;

const PROJECT_ANALYSIS_PROTOCOL = `This protocol guides you in analyzing a new or unfamiliar project to gain context before making changes.

**Mandatory Workflow:**
1.  **File System Scan:** Your first action MUST be to call \`listFiles()\` to get a complete overview of the project structure.
2.  **Identify Key Files:** From the file list, identify the most important files for understanding the project. These typically include:
    -   Configuration files (\`package.json\`, \`vite.config.ts\`, etc.)
    -   The main HTML file (\`index.html\`)
    -   The main application entry point (\`index.tsx\`, \`App.tsx\`, \`main.tsx\`, etc.)
    -   Core component files (e.g., \`components/Header.tsx\`, \`views/CodeView.tsx\`).
3.  **Read and Analyze:** Call \`readFile()\` on these key files. Analyze their content to understand:
    -   **Dependencies:** What libraries or frameworks are being used? (from \`package.json\` or import statements)
    -   **Structure:** How is the application organized? What are the main components?
    -   **Purpose:** What does the application seem to do?
4.  **Summarize and Memorize:** Synthesize your findings into a concise summary. Then, you MUST call \`updateShortTermMemory()\` with the key 'project_summary' to store this summary. This ensures you have this context for all subsequent actions in the current task.

**Example Summary:**
"This is a React project using Vite and Tailwind CSS. The main entry point is 'index.tsx', which renders the 'App' component. The app is a code editor with multiple views. Key components include Header, CodeView, and PreviewView."
`;

const REACT_STYLE_GUIDE = `This protocol outlines the official VibeCode style guide for creating React applications. You MUST adhere to these guidelines when writing or modifying JSX components to maintain a consistent, modern, and aesthetically pleasing user interface.

**Core Principles:**
- **Technology:** Use React with TypeScript and function components with Hooks. All styling MUST be done using Tailwind CSS utility classes.
- **Aesthetic ("The Vibe"):** Clean, minimalist, dark-themed, and responsive.
- **Mobile-First:** Design components to look and work great on small screens first, then scale up to larger screens using Tailwind's responsive prefixes (e.g., \`md:\`, \`lg:\`).

**Color Palette (Vibe Theme):**
- **Main Background:** \`bg-vibe-bg-deep\` (e.g., for the overall page background).
- **Panel/Card Background:** \`bg-vibe-panel\` (e.g., for modals, cards, sidebars).
- **Primary Text:** \`text-vibe-text\`.
- **Secondary/Subtle Text:** \`text-vibe-text-secondary\`.
- **Muted/Comment Text:** \`text-vibe-comment\`.
- **Primary Accent/Buttons:** \`bg-vibe-accent\` for background, \`text-white\` for text.
- **Accent Hover State:** \`hover:bg-vibe-accent-hover\`.
- **Borders:** \`border-vibe-panel\` or \`border-vibe-comment\`.

**Layout & Spacing:**
- Use Flexbox (\`flex\`, \`items-center\`, \`justify-between\`) and Grid (\`grid\`, \`grid-cols-*\`) for layouts.
- Use consistent spacing with Tailwind's spacing scale (e.g., \`p-4\`, \`m-2\`, \`gap-4\`). Avoid arbitrary values.
- Components should be well-spaced and not feel cramped.

**Common UI Patterns**

*   **Full-Screen Views:** To make a container fill the entire viewport (e.g., for a full-screen preview), use fixed positioning and inset properties.
    \`\`\`jsx
    const FullScreenComponent = () => (
      <div className="fixed inset-0 z-50 bg-vibe-bg-deep flex flex-col">
        {/* Full screen content goes here */}
      </div>
    );
    \`\`\`

*   **Modals:** A modal consists of a backdrop and a panel. The backdrop covers the screen and centers the panel.
    \`\`\`jsx
    const Modal = ({ onClose }) => (
      <div 
        className="fixed inset-0 bg-vibe-bg/80 backdrop-blur-sm z-50 flex items-center justify-center p-4"
        onClick={onClose}
      >
        <div 
          className="bg-vibe-panel rounded-lg shadow-2xl w-full max-w-md"
          onClick={e => e.stopPropagation()} // Prevents closing when clicking inside the modal
        >
          <h2 className="text-xl p-4 border-b border-vibe-bg-deep">Modal Title</h2>
          <div className="p-4">Modal content...</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
    \`\`\`

*   **Loading & Disabled States:** Clearly indicate when an action is in progress. Disable buttons to prevent multiple clicks.
    \`\`\`jsx
    const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
    // ...
    <button
      disabled={isLoading}
      className="bg-vibe-accent text-white px-4 py-2 rounded-md flex items-center justify-center hover:bg-vibe-accent-hover disabled:bg-vibe-comment disabled:cursor-wait"
    >
      {isLoading && <SpinnerIcon className="w-5 h-5 mr-2 animate-spin" />}
      {isLoading ? 'Saving...' : 'Save'}
    </button>
    \`\`\`

**File Naming:**
- **Components:** PascalCase (e.g., \`Button.tsx\`, \`UserProfile.tsx\`).
- **Hooks:** camelCase with \`use\` prefix (e.g., \`useUserData.ts\`).
- **Utilities:** camelCase (e.g., \`dateFormatter.ts\`).
`;

const DEBUGGING_PROTOCOL = `This protocol provides a systematic workflow for diagnosing and fixing errors.

**Workflow:**
1.  **Acknowledge & Identify:** State that you are entering debugging mode. Identify whether the error is from the build process or from the application at runtime.
2.  **Gather Data:**
    -   For **build errors**, you MUST call \`viewBuildOutput()\`.
    -   For **runtime errors**, you MUST call \`viewRuntimeErrors()\`.
3.  **Analyze:** Carefully analyze the error message, stack trace, and any relevant logs to understand the root cause.
4.  **Contextualize:** If the error references a specific file and line number, you MUST call \`readFile()\` on that file to examine the code in context.
5.  **Hypothesize & Plan:** Use the \`think()\` tool to state your hypothesis about the bug and outline the specific code changes you will make to fix it.
6.  **Execute Fix:** Use \`writeFile()\` to apply your planned fix to the virtual filesystem.
7.  **Verify:**
    a. Call \`switchView('preview')\` to trigger a new build and run the application.
    b. Re-check for errors using \`viewBuildOutput()\` and \`viewRuntimeErrors()\`.
8.  **Iterate or Finalize:**
    -   If the fix is unsuccessful, return to Step 3 and re-analyze the new error.
    -   If the fix is successful and the application works as expected, call \`commitToHead()\` to save your changes.
`;

const FEATURE_TRACING_PROTOCOL = `This protocol is for understanding how an existing feature is implemented in the codebase before you modify it.

**Workflow:**
1.  **Initial Scan:** Call \`listFiles()\` to get a map of the entire project structure.
2.  **Identify Entry Points:** Based on the user's request (e.g., "change the header"), identify the most likely starting files. Good candidates are \`App.tsx\`, \`index.tsx\`, or component files with matching names (e.g., \`Header.tsx\`).
3.  **Code Walkthrough:**
    a. Call \`readFile()\` on your chosen entry point file.
    b. Follow the chain of \`import\` statements and component usages. For each relevant component or function you discover, call \`readFile()\` on its source file.
    c. Continue this process until you have a clear picture of the data flow and component hierarchy related to the feature.
4.  **Summarize & Memorize:** Use the \`think()\` tool to create a concise summary of your findings. The summary should include the key files, components, props, and state involved in the feature.
5.  **Store Context:** You MUST call \`updateShortTermMemory()\` with the key 'feature_trace_summary' and your summary as the value. This stores your understanding for the rest of the task.
6.  **Confirm Readiness:** Inform the user that you have analyzed the feature and are ready to proceed with their requested changes.
`;

const GIT_COMMIT_PROTOCOL = `This protocol guides you in creating high-quality, Conventional Commit messages.

**Workflow:**
1.  **View Changes:** Your first action MUST be to call \`viewWorkspaceChanges()\`. This provides the diffs for all uncommitted work.
2.  **Analyze Diffs:** Carefully review the code changes to understand the scope and intent.
3.  **Formulate Message:** Craft a commit message that STRICTLY follows the Conventional Commits specification:
    \`\`\`
    <type>(<scope>): <subject>
    
    <body>
    \`\`\`
    - **type:** Must be one of: \`feat\`, \`fix\`, \`docs\`, \`style\`, \`refactor\`, \`test\`, \`chore\`.
    - **scope (optional):** The part of the codebase affected (e.g., \`auth\`, \`ui\`, \`git\`).
    - **subject:** A concise summary in the imperative mood (e.g., "add login button" not "added login button"). Do NOT capitalize the first letter or end with a period.
    - **body (optional):** A more detailed explanation.
4.  **Populate UI:** You MUST call \`populateCommitMessage()\` with your complete, formatted message.
5.  **Inform User:** Announce that the commit message is ready for review in the Git panel. Do not attempt to perform the commit yourself.
`;

const USER_FEEDBACK_PROTOCOL = `This protocol governs how you present your work to the user.

**Workflow:**
1.  **Present Work:** After implementing a visible change (e.g., a UI update), your first action MUST be to call \`switchView('preview')\`.
2.  **Announce Completion:** Immediately after switching the view, state concisely what you have done and that it is ready for review.
    -   *Example:* "The login button has been added and is now visible in the preview."
3.  **Stop and Wait:** After your announcement, stop executing tools. Wait for the user's next command, which will be their feedback. Do not ask "What do you think?" or solicit a response.
`;

const APP_CREATION_PROTOCOL = `This protocol provides a strict, step-by-step guide for creating a new React application from scratch. You MUST follow these steps exactly when a user asks to create a new app in an empty or new project.

**Mandatory Workflow:**

1.  **Create \`index.html\`:** Call \`writeFile\` to create an \`index.html\` file. The content MUST be the standard VibeCode HTML boilerplate, including a root div and the Tailwind CSS CDN script.
    \`\`\`html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <title>New VibeCode App</title>
        <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
      </head>
      <body>
        <div id="root"></div>
      </body>
    </html>
    \`\`\`

2.  **Create \`style.css\`:** Call \`writeFile\` to create a \`style.css\` file. The content should provide basic, theme-aligned body styles.
    \`\`\`css
    body {
      font-family: sans-serif;
      background-color: #1a1b26; /* vibe-bg */
      color: #c0caf5; /* vibe-text */
    }
    \`\`\`

3.  **Create \`index.tsx\`:** Call \`writeFile\` to create the main application entry point, \`index.tsx\`. This file MUST import React, ReactDOM, and the new \`style.css\`. It should render a simple placeholder component based on the user's request into the 'root' div.

4.  **Finalize:** After creating all three files, you MUST call \`commitToHead\` to save the new application to the user's workspace.

5.  **Inform User:** Announce that the new application has been created and is ready to be viewed in the preview.
`;

const FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_PROTOCOL = `This protocol is for implementing new features holistically. You MUST go beyond just creating UI elements and ensure the feature is fully functional.

**Core Principle: Deconstruct the Request**
When a user asks for a new feature (e.g., "add a dark mode toggle"), you must break it down into three parts: UI, State, and Logic.

1.  **UI (The View):**
    *   Create the necessary JSX elements for the feature.
    *   You MUST follow the \`react_style_guide\` for all styling and layout.
    *   Ensure the UI is responsive and accessible.

2.  **State (The Data):**
    *   Identify what information needs to be stored to make the feature work.
    *   Use the \`useState\` hook for simple, component-level state.
    *   *Example:* For a toggle, you need state: \`const [isToggled, setIsToggled] = useState(false);\`.

3.  **Logic (The Control):**
    *   Write the functions that update the state and perform the feature's actions.
    *   This is where you implement the "how". Do not create placeholder functions.

**Implementation Examples:**

*   **If asked for a full-screen button:** You MUST implement the full logic, not just a button.
    1.  **State:** Add a state variable to the appropriate component: \`const [isFullScreen, setIsFullScreen] = useState(false);\`.
    2.  **UI:** Create the button and a container. Use conditional classes based on the state.
        \`\`\`jsx
        <div className={isFullScreen ? 'fixed inset-0 z-50 bg-vibe-bg-deep' : 'relative'}>
          <button onClick={() => setIsFullScreen(p => !p)}>
            {isFullScreen ? 'Exit Full Screen' : 'Go Full Screen'}
          </button>
          {/* ... content ... */}
        </div>
        \`\`\`
    3.  **Logic:** The \`onClick\` handler contains the logic.

*   **If asked to play a sound:** You MUST NOT use an \`<audio>\` tag. You MUST use the Web Audio API for full control.
    1.  **Logic:** Create a function that generates and plays the sound.
        \`\`\`jsx
        const playSound = () => {
          // Use an existing AudioContext or create one.
          const audioContext = new (window.AudioContext || window.webkitAudioContext)();
          const oscillator = audioContext.createOscillator();
          const gainNode = audioContext.createGain();

          oscillator.connect(gainNode);
          gainNode.connect(audioContext.destination);

          oscillator.type = 'sine'; // or 'square', 'sawtooth', 'triangle'
          oscillator.frequency.setValueAtTime(440, audioContext.currentTime); // A4 note
          gainNode.gain.setValueAtTime(0.5, audioContext.currentTime);

          oscillator.start(audioContext.currentTime);
          oscillator.stop(audioContext.currentTime + 0.3); // Play for 0.3 seconds
        };
        \`\`\`
    2.  **UI:** Create a button that calls this function.
        \`\`\`jsx
        <button onClick={playSound}>Play Sound</button>
        \`\`\`

**Final Step:** After implementing all three parts, switch to the preview to verify the feature works as expected.
