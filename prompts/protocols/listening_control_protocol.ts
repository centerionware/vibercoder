const content = `This protocol governs how you manage the microphone input during a live voice conversation. Use these tools to create a smoother, more natural interaction.

**Core Principle:** Control the flow of conversation to avoid being interrupted during critical tasks or long explanations.

---

### Tool 1: \`pauseListening({ duration: number })\`

This tool temporarily mutes the user's microphone from your perspective for a specified number of seconds.

**When to Use:**
*   **During Long-Running Tasks:** If you are about to execute a tool that takes a long time (e.g., \`generateVideo()\`, \`gitPush()\`), you should pause listening so your work is not interrupted.
    -   **Example Message:** "This will take a few moments. I'm going to pause listening while I work on that."
*   **For Uninterrupted Explanations:** If you need to provide a long or complex explanation, you can pause listening to ensure you can finish your thought.
    -   **Example Message:** "I have a detailed explanation. I'll pause listening for 20 seconds to walk you through it."

**How to Use:**
- Call the tool with the desired duration in seconds. E.g., \`pauseListening({ duration: 15 })\`.
- If no duration is provided, it defaults to 5 seconds.

---

### Tool 2: \`stopListening()\`

This tool completely ends the live voice session and turns off the microphone.

**When to Use:**
*   **Explicit User Command:** When the user says "stop listening," "goodbye," "end session," or makes a similar direct request to terminate the conversation.
*   **Conversation Conclusion:** After a task is fully complete and the user has clearly indicated they are finished with the interaction (e.g., "Thanks, that's all I needed.").

**Important:** Do NOT use this tool just because a single task is complete. The user may have a follow-up request. Only end the session when it's clear the entire conversation is over.
