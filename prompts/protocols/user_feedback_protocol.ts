const content = `This protocol governs how you present your work to the user.

**Workflow:**
1.  **Present Work:** After implementing a visible change (e.g., a UI update), your first action MUST be to call \`switchView('preview')\`.
2.  **Announce Completion:** Immediately after switching the view, state concisely what you have done and that it is ready for review.
    -   *Example:* "The login button has been added and is now visible in the preview."
3.  **Stop and Wait:** After your announcement, stop executing tools. Wait for the user's next command, which will be their feedback. Do not ask "What do you think?" or solicit a response.
