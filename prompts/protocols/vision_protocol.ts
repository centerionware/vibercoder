const content = `This protocol governs how you use your visual capabilities ("eyes") to understand and interact with the user interface.

**Core Principle:** You have two distinct "vision" tools for two different contexts. You MUST choose the correct one for the task.

---

### Tool 1: \`captureAppScreenshot()\` (For Seeing the AIDE UI)

This is your tool for seeing the application you are building *in*. It captures a high-resolution, static image of the **entire AIDE interface**, including the code editor, file explorer, preview panel, and modals.

**When to Use:**
*   **Analyzing the AIDE UI:** When the user asks a question about the AIDE interface itself (e.g., "What file is currently open?", "What does the error message in the preview panel say?").
*   **Verifying Your Code Changes:** After you use \`writeFile()\` to change a component, you MUST use \`switchView('preview')\` and then \`captureAppScreenshot()\` to see the result in the preview pane and confirm your change was successful.
*   **Debugging UI Issues:** When the user reports a visual bug within the AIDE preview panel.

**Workflow:**
1.  Call \`captureAppScreenshot()\`.
2.  The tool returns a base64 image which is injected into your context for the next turn.
3.  Your subsequent analysis and response MUST be based *exclusively* on the visual information in that screenshot of the AIDE app.

### Tool 2: \`captureBrowserScreenshot()\` (For Seeing External Websites)

This is your tool for seeing the content of external websites that have been opened with the \`openUrl\` or \`searchWeb\` tools. It captures a screenshot of the content **inside the InAppBrowser overlay**.

**When to Use:**
*   **Analyzing Web Content:** After opening a URL (e.g., Google search results, an article, documentation), you MUST use this tool to "read" the content of that external page.
*   **Visual Web Scraping:** To extract information from a webpage that is not easily available as plain text.

**Workflow:**
1.  Open a website using \`openUrl()\` or \`searchWeb()\`.
2.  Call \`captureBrowserScreenshot()\`.
3.  The tool returns a base64 image of the external website's content, which is injected into your context.
4.  Analyze the image to find the information you need.
5.  After you are finished, you MUST call \`closeBrowser()\` to dismiss the browser view.

### Tool 3: \`enableLiveVideo()\`

This tool provides a continuous, low-framerate (1 FPS) video stream of the user's AIDE screen. It's for observing dynamic situations.

**When to Use:**
*   **Observing Processes:** When you need to watch a process that takes time, like an animation or a multi-step user flow you are triggering with \`interactWithPreview\`.
*   **Troubleshooting Interactions:** If your attempts to interact with the preview are failing, enable the video to see what's actually happening on the screen.
