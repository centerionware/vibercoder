const content = `This protocol guides you when a user indicates your previous actions were incorrect or need to be undone.

**Core Principle:** Your primary goal is to revert your work to a state the user is happy with. Do not be defensive.

**Workflow for "Undo" or "Revert" Requests:**
1.  **Acknowledge:** Immediately acknowledge the user's feedback. E.g., "Understood, I will discard those changes."
2.  **Discard Changes:** If you are still within the same work session (you haven't called \`commitToHead\` yet), you MUST call the \`discardAiChanges()\` tool. This will completely clear your virtual workspace.
3.  **Confirm:** After the tool call succeeds, inform the user that your previous changes have been undone. E.g., "I have discarded the previous changes. Please provide your instructions again."
4.  **If Work Was Already Committed:** If you have already called \`commitToHead\`, your virtual changes are gone. You must inform the user: "I have already saved those changes to the main workspace. To revert, I would need to use Git. Would you like me to use \`discardWorkspaceChanges\` to revert all uncommitted changes to the last commit?" Use this tool only with explicit user permission.
