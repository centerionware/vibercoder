    "value": "This project is a React-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that runs in the browser. It uses Vite as a bundler and includes various components for code editing, a live preview, Git integration, and an AI assistant. Key libraries include Monaco Editor for code editing and Isomorphic Git for Git operations. It uses Capacitor for native mobile builds and can also be packaged as an Electron desktop app. The UI is styled with Tailwind CSS."

It contains an abstraction layer in `index.ts` that can switch between different bundler types, currently defaulting to `esbuild`. The `esbuild/` subfolder contains the implementation for esbuild-wasm, including `index.ts` for the main bundling logic, `service.ts` for initializing the web assembly, and `plugins/` for custom esbuild plugins. `unpkgPathPlugin.ts` handles module resolution, including resolving bare imports from a CDN (esm.sh) and relative paths, potentially using an import map from `index.html`. `fetchPlugin.ts` handles fetching file content, either from the local virtual file system or from a CDN, and also manages CSS imports. The `vite/` subfolder contains a placeholder for a future Vite-based bundler implementation. The `types.ts` file defines the `BundleResult` and `OnLog` interfaces."

Subfolders organize components by feature: `ai/` for AI chat UI, `browser/` for the browser view, `icons/` for SVG icon components, `modals/` for various modal dialogues (settings, history, git), `preview/` for the preview pane UI, and `views/` for the main page layouts of each section.

    "value": "The `electron/` folder contains the necessary code to run the AIDE web application as a standalone desktop application using Electron. `main.js` is the main process entry point; it creates the Electron window, loads the `index.html` file of the web app, and sets up an IPC (Inter-Process Communication) handler. `preload.js` acts as a secure bridge between the web app (renderer process) and the main process, exposing a `gitHttpRequest` function. This function is used by the web app's git service to perform network requests in the main process, which is not restricted by CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), thus enabling Git operations with services like GitHub. The `README.md` file provides a detailed explanation of this architecture."

The `useAiChat/` subfolder provides the core logic for AI text-based conversations, handling sending messages, processing streaming responses, and managing tool execution via `chatSessionManager.ts`, `streamProcessor.ts`, `toolExecutor.ts`, and `turnManager.ts`. `useAiLive/` is for the real-time AI assistant, managing audio recording/playback and handling live interactions. Other hooks like `useBrowser.ts`, `useDebug.ts`, `useFiles.ts`, `useGitLogic.ts`, `usePreviewBundler.ts`, `useProjects.ts`, `useSettings.ts`, `useThreads.ts`, `useUIState.ts`, `useVFS.ts`, and `useWakeWord.ts` manage specific aspects of the IDE's functionality, such as the file system, project state, git operations, UI state, and AI wake word detection. The `types.ts` file in `useAiChat/` defines the interfaces for the AI chat turn state."

Each protocol file (e.g., `lead_engineer_protocol.ts`, `debugging_protocol.ts`, `git_commit_protocol.ts`) provides a specific set of guidelines and a workflow for the AI to follow when performing a particular type of task, ensuring its actions are structured and aligned with best practices."

The worker is used for performance in standard web environments to prevent UI freezing. The worker handles cloning, committing, pushing, pulling, rebasing, and file status checks using `isomorphic-git` and `LightningFS` for the virtual file system. `toolOrchestrator.ts` aggregates all the AI tool declarations and provides a `systemInstruction` that dictates the AI's core cognitive cycle and workflow. It also includes a factory function `createToolImplementations` to instantiate all tool methods with their necessary dependencies. `aiTools.ts`, `nativeFetch.ts`, and `nativeHttp.ts` are placeholders for future AI tool orchestrations and native network implementations."
