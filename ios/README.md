# /ios Directory

This directory contains the native Xcode project for VibeCode.

## Managed by Capacitor

**Warning:** This directory is automatically generated and managed by [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/). You should not edit the Capacitor-generated files directly, as your changes will be overwritten.

To make changes to the native project (e.g., adding custom plugins, modifying `Info.plist`), you should do so within Xcode after running:

```bash
npm run open:ios
```

## How it Works

1.  The `npm run build:web` command prepares the web assets.
2.  The `npm run sync:native` command copies the web assets from the `/www` directory into this Xcode project.
3.  You then open this project in Xcode to build, run on an emulator/device, and generate a signed `.ipa` archive for release.
